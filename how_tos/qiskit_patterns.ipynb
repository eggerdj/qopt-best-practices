    "- In Step 3. we will iterativelly call the `Sampler` primitive in Qiskit to draw samples from the quantum circuits that Step 2. prepared., and use those samples in the loss function of our algorithmic routine\n",

This will be the reference state for our iterative quantum execution. Step 2 of the Qiskit Patterns focuses on tuning the circuit for optimal quantum execution through **transpilation**. The Qiskit library offers a series of **Transpilation Passes** that cater to a wide range of circuit transformations. We don't only want to get a circuit, but we want to make sure that the circuit is **optimized** for our purpose. In the context of QAOA, we care about matching the qubit configuration of the quantum chip to the graph defined by the cost function Hamiltonian. By manually tuning this configuration, we can ensure that the final layout will not involve unnecessary operations that would increase the noise level of our samples."
